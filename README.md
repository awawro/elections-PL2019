# 2019 parliamentary elections in Poland

### The project
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize the results of the parliamentary election in Poland in 2019. Typically, seats won and turnout receive most attention from media outlets. Here I took advanatge of the detailed results from every polling district [obwodowe komisje wyborcze] in the coutry, published by the National Electoral Commission, and tried to look deeper into the results.

### The basics
Parliamentary elections in Poland are held every four years. During the elections, all 460 members of the Sejm, the lower house of the parliament, are elected in 41 multi-member electoral districts, and all members of the Senate, the upper house, are elected in single-member electoral districts.
The size of electoral districts (okrÄ™g wyborczy) for the Sejm varies between 600,000 and 1,600,000 inhabitants and determines the number of members elected in that district. Citizens voting abroad elect candidates from the largest district - 'Warszawa I' - independently from their residency in the country. Each electoral district is served by a number of polling stations (obwodowa komisja wyborcza).
